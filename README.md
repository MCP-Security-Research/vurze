# Vurze

Version control your Python functions and classes with automated cryptographic decorator injection

- ⚡️ **Lightning Fast** - Built with Rust for maximum performance
- 🔐 **Cryptographic Security** - Ed25519 signatures ensure code integrity and authorship
- 🛠️ **CLI & Library** - Use as a command-line tool or import as a Python package
- 🔍 **Attack Detection** - Automatically detects tampering with function code or docstrings
- 📦 **PyO3 Powered** - Seamless Python-Rust integration via PyO3 bindings

vurze helps you maintain code integrity by automatically adding cryptographic signatures to your Python functions and classes. Each function receives a unique decorator containing a cryptographic signature that verifies both authorship and integrity, making it easy to detect tool poisoning attacks and unauthorized code modifications.

development notes:

```text
COMMANDS I FOLLOWED TO SETUP MATURIN:
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv tool install maturin
maturin init
select pyo3

COMMANDS I FOLLOWED TO TEST MATURIN INITIALLY:
maturin develop
python -c "import vurze; print('Vurze imported successfully!')"

COMMANDS FOR TESTING CLI
maturin develop --release
vurze --help
```

todo:

- do i need to fix my python import paths/strucutre of project?
- fix spacing issues within adding decorators
- ensure tool works with recursive functions and classes
- start adding tests to make sure tool continues to work
- also start to measure the performance of the tool
- use git api to track diffs? (other option is using my own .vurze metadata file)
- update the cli to use rich console for better
- update to use ruff to lint python code
- update to use ____ to lint rust code
- create a finalized readme file
- hook up to pypi for first release and set up github actions for publishing / releasing
